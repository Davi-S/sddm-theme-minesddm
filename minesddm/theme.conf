passwordMode = fixedMask
# The passwordMode controls if and how the password is masked. The available password modes are:
# plain         - Do not mask the password and show it in plain text
# fixedMask     - Mask the password with passwordFixedMaskString cut to the same length as the entered password,
#                 repeating passwordFixedMaskString if the entered password is longer than the former.
# noEcho        - Display nothing.
# randomMask    - Mask the password with a randomly generated string cut to the same length as the entered password.
# jitterMask    - Same as randomMask, but randomize the masking string on each input update.

# passwordFixedMaskString can be arbitrarily long but it must not be the empty string
passwordFixedMaskString = "*"

################################ Placeholders ################################

# The following placeholders are supported:
# {username}              - The text entered into the username text field.
# {password}              - The text entered into the password text field.
# {maskedPassword}        - The masking text shown in the password text field. Note that this is
#                           always empty if the passwordMode `noEcho` is used.
# {actionIndex}           - The index action currently selected for the bottom right button.
# {nextActionIndex}       - The next action index that will be cycled to.
# {sessionName}           - The name of the session currently selected. May be the empty string
#                           if the session name is still loading or if it failed to load.
# {sessionComment}        - The short description of the session currently selected. Like
#                           {sessionName}, this might also be the empty string.
# {sessionIndex}          - The index of the session currently selected.
# {sessionsCount}         - The number of sessions to choose from.
# {sessionsInitialized}   - If the sessions have been loaded, this evaluates to "true", otherwise "".
# {...?...:...}           - Ternary operator. Evaluates to the first value (after the `?`) if the string before
#                           the `?` is non-empty; otherwise, it evaluates to the second value (after the `:`). The
#                           strings can be any arbitrary text or expression. For example: {{username}?Hi!:{password}}
#                           evaluates to "Hi!" if a character has been typed into the username text field and
#                           evaluates to the typed password if the username text field is empty. {foo?bar:baz}
#                           always evaluates to "bar", since the string before `?` is non-empty.

# The escape character is '%'. Use it to insert reserved characters literally:
# %%    - Inserts a literal '%' character.
# %{    - Inserts a literal '{' character.
# %}    - Inserts a literal '}' character.
# %?    - Inserts a literal '?' character.
# %:    - Inserts a literal ':' character.
# This is useful when you want to include these symbols in output without triggering placeholder or ternary logic.

# Making it look as close to Minecraft as possible #
####################################################
# Here are some recommendations that could be useful if you want
# this theme to match the look of Minecraft as closely as possible:

# mainTitleText = "Create New World"
# usernamePlaceholder = ""
# usernameBottomLabel = "Will be saved in: {{username}?{username}:World}"
# passwordTopLabel = "Seed"
# passwordPlaceholder = ""
# passwordBottomLabel = "Leave blank for a random seed"
# sessionText = "{{sessionsInitialized}?{{sessionName}?Game Mode%: {sessionName}:No sessions found}:Loading sessions...}"
# textLoginButton = "Create New World"
# textPowerOffButton = "Cancel"
# passwordMode = randomMask

# Depending on the length of your password, you might want to set maskCharsPerTypedChar
# to some value >1 to make it look like you are entering a longer seed:
# maskCharsPerTypedChar = 2

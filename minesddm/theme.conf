# plain         - Do not mask the password and show it in plain text
# fixedMask     - Mask the password with passwordFixedMaskString cut to the same length as the entered password.
#                 Repeat passwordFixedMaskString if the entered password is longer than the former.
# noEcho        - Display nothing.
# randomMask    - Mask the password with a randomly generated string cut to the same length as the entered password.
